=====TO DO=====
-[1] look at Josh's thesis for anything about induction for use in section 1.3?
-[2] give examples of formalizing intuitions in other fields (e.g. distance in topology, chance in probability)

MAIN IDEAS
-Cognition is about finding structure
-Structure defined as common computation
-Finding structure can be interpreted as program induction
-Grammar inference as an approach to program induction
-Probabilistic inference as a principled approach to learning grammars

COGNITION AND STRUCTURE
-Survival depends on induction i.e. structure [1]
-Past representations of concept
-How do we define structure?
     -Formal methods [2]
-The number game
  {2,4,6,8}
  {68,77,44,20}
-Trees
